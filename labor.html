	<h1>Industrial Revolution</h1>
	<p>In Humanities, we connected the project to the topic through child labor and modern inventions like social media. For both topics, I had to write a poem, create an art piece based off that poem, and write a relfection on those.</p>
	<h2>Child Labor</h2>
	<img src="images/child.png">
	<p>Sweat drips down the browline</p>
	<p>	Of a quiet young Fraulein</p>
	<p>But until her boss says she can go home</p>
	<p>She works herself to the bone</p>
	<p>Her family needs the money</p>
	<p>For business that’s anything but funny</p>
	<p>They might die without being able to pay for bread</p>
	<p>But her daily work is what she dreads</p>
	<p>Children who don’t work are one to none</p>
	<p>But she still works herself to the bone</p>
	<p>No school for her,</p>
	<p>Because once you’re working that’s over</p>
	<p>Childhood’s not crucial,</p>
	<p>You’re either useful or unuseful</p>
	<p>And although she lets out a painful moan</p>
	<p>She still works herself to the bone</p>
	<p>Her tired eyes droop with the weight of sleep</p>
	<p>Awake is what she aims to keep</p>
	<p>The string is a familiar enemy</p>
	<p>Against her, her boss must hold an enmity</p>
	<p>She lets out a light sigh and a quiet grown</p>
	<p>As she continues to work herself to the bone</p>

	<h2>Social Media and Gender</h2>
	<p>Hugging me just right</p>
	<p>Not too loose or too tight</p>
	<p>I think you’re beautiful</p>
	<p>But others look at you like you’re pitiful</p>
	<p>Is it because of my chest?</p>
	<p>Maybe my hips or my thighs?</p>
	<p>I don’t think I look a mess,</p>
	<p>So why is that where they rest their eyes?</p>
	<p>Right, I’m a woman</p>
	<p>All that matters is my boobs</p>
	<p>All that matters are my legs</p>
	<p>That’s all that’s true, man</p>
	<p>“You need to look pretty”</p>
	<p>But make sure you don’t look too hot</p>
	<p>“All women are queens”</p>
	<p>But if she breathes, she’s a thot</p>
