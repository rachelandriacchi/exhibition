		<p>Humans make history. We are constantly making changes to how the world works. This website shows my two projects in which I coded human history.</p>
		<p>In World History, I interviewed a subject who's history I wanted to learn more about. I made a map of every location mentioned in the interview, whether that was places they lived or places they had visited, or never even been before.</p>
		<p>In Humanities, we made a layered self portrait using Photoshop. I had to choose 25 pictures that related to personality traits I got from the VIA personality test, as well as things that related to some of my goals for 2018. I also did the same thing with the subjects we interviewed for History. I had to choose 25 pictures of things mentioned in their interview and make it into a layered self portrait. I also wrote an essay based on one of the topics that was brought up during the interview.</p>
		<p>Recently, we have been learning about the Industrial Revolution, a period that lasted from approximately 1750 to 1850. During this time, new inventions and innovations came to fruition across the world, especially in Europe and North America. With a group, I had to research a chosen inventions (in my case, the spinning jenny), draw a sketch, and finally, make a model of it. In Humanities, we connected the project to the topic through child labor and modern inventions like social media. For both topics, I had to write a poem, create an art piece based off that poem, and write a relfection on those.<p>
